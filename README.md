# Elemental Bot
This bot is a successor primarily to Elemental on Discord, but also games such as Elemental 1-3, Doodle God, and Little Alchemy.


To run this yourself, you'll need an application.properties file. Currently, I'm hardcoding certain elements as created by myself, so my ID is stored in the application.properties, and the token for my bot is stored in application.properties.
